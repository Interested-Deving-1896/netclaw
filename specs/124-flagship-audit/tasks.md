# Tasks: NetClaw Flagship Audit

## Phase 1 — Setup

- [x] T001 Capture user clarification, scope and platform matrix in specs/124-flagship-audit/spec.md and clarification.md (FR-014).
- [x] T002 Establish GAIT session and persisted intake in specs/124-flagship-audit/handoff.md and memory/2026-09-26.md (FR-011).
- [x] T003 Enumerate tracked files and ownership/review status in specs/124-flagship-audit/coverage.json; capture host/tool availability in verification.md (FR-001, FR-014).

## Phase 2 — Foundation

- [x] T004 Inspect tests/contract-suites.json and its harnesses for side effects, then record reconciliation and contract baseline under specs/124-flagship-audit/evidence/ (FR-001, FR-008).
- [x] T005 Create finding ledger and trust-boundary review map in specs/124-flagship-audit/findings.md (FR-002, FR-003).
- [x] T006 Correct stale canonical spec path with a documented PATCH amendment in .specify/memory/constitution.md; preserve all policy principles (FR-010, FR-012).

## Phase 3 — US1: Evidence and security repair

Independent test: coverage inventory has every baseline tracked path and every confirmed finding has reproduction, impact and evidence.

- [ ] T007 [US1] Review install/CLI/dependency/CI boundaries in scripts/, config/, .github/workflows/, .env.example and dependency manifests; record findings in specs/124-flagship-audit/findings.md (FR-003, FR-004).
- [ ] T008 [US1] Review HTTP/WebSocket/auth/upload/process boundaries in ui/netclaw-visual/server.js and ui/netclaw-visual/src/; reproduce confirmed defects in targeted tests (FR-003, FR-004).
- [ ] T009 [US1] Review peer identity, authorization, grants, execution and audit paths in mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/bgp/federation/ and mcp-servers/n2n-mcp/; record evidence (FR-003, FR-004).
- [ ] T010 [US1] Review ingestion/retrieval/replication, persistence, GCF correctness and resource limits in mcp-servers/rag-mcp/, mcp-servers/memory-mcp/ and src/netclaw_tokens/ (FR-003, FR-004).
- [ ] T011 [US1] Review remaining MCP servers and workspace/skills/ against actual tool schemas, read/write enforcement and transport/dependency behavior; record per-server coverage in coverage.json (FR-003, FR-004).
- [ ] T012 [US1] Review mobile enrollment, approvals, capture, watch relay, voice and Zoom boundaries in mobile/netclaw-mobile/, mcp-servers/twilio-voice-mcp/ and mcp-servers/protocol-mcp/bgp/federation/zoom_channel.py (FR-003, FR-004).
- [ ] T013 [US1] Review docs/, specs/, examples/, lab/, labs/, captures/, benchmarks/, root operating files and asset/generated boundaries; complete coverage dispositions in coverage.json (FR-001, FR-004).
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add finding-specific remediation tasks with exact source/test paths to this tasks.md and rerun cross-artifact analysis before each repair batch; implement and verify all confirmed defects, retaining blockers in findings.md (FR-005, FR-013).

## Phase 4 — US2: Trustworthy normal/failure behavior

Independent test: audited entry points preserve authorization and distinguish failures, empty/partial/stale data, with negative-case evidence.

- [x] T015 [US2] Resolve offline suite failures and dependency gaps in tests/contract-suites.json and owning source/test paths; record exact outcomes in verification.md (FR-005, FR-008).
- [x] T016 [US2] Run HUD Node tests/build and mobile available checks from ui/netclaw-visual/package.json and mobile/netclaw-mobile/; document platform gaps (FR-004, FR-014).
- [x] T017 [US2] Measure identified performance bottlenecks with reproducible fixtures under benchmarks/ and evidence/; implement only supported improvements (FR-006).
- [x] T018 [US2] Create concrete lab/platform requests and acceptance procedures in specs/124-flagship-audit/verification.md, execute available lab checks and retain unavailable checks as blockers (FR-008, FR-014).

## Phase 5 — US3: Safe adoption

Independent test: every breaking change has verified preview/apply/repeat/failure/recovery scenarios against preserved old-state fixtures.

- [x] T019 [US3] Classify each repair as compatible or breaking in findings.md; for breaking changes extend contracts/audit-and-migration.md with exact CLI/state behavior and add source/test tasks before implementation (FR-007).
- [x] T020 [US3] Implement and verify all required finding-specific migration scripts under scripts/ and corresponding tests/; record backup, state-preservation and recovery evidence in verification.md (FR-007).
- [ ] T021 [US3] Exercise isolated install/upgrade smoke tests for required platforms using scripts/install.sh and scripts/lib/; only if host replacement is needed, preserve/verify local state and restore a working installation (FR-009, FR-014).

## Phase 6 — US4: Coherence and handoff

Independent test: another session can resume from handoff without conversation history; each requirement links to tasks and evidence.

- [x] T022 [US4] Repair GAIT skill/server contract drift in workspace/skills/gait-session-tracking/SKILL.md and affected callers after finding-specific task review (FR-010, FR-011).
- [x] T023 [US4] Update changed capability documentation/registration/installer/skills/HUD artifacts, including README.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md where applicable, and run coherence gates (FR-010).
- [x] T024 [US4] Review source and rendered Markdown for changed user guidance and fix broken links/formatting; record evidence in verification.md (FR-010).
- [x] T025 [US4] Maintain specs/124-flagship-audit/analysis.md and requirement→task→evidence mapping through repair batches; close all analysis findings (FR-012).

## Final phase — Completion

- [ ] T026 Re-run required checks after final fixes and complete severity-sorted audit report in specs/124-flagship-audit/findings.md, with every gap visible (FR-001–FR-014).
- [ ] T027 Write local milestone blog draft in specs/124-flagship-audit/blog-draft.md, final handoff.md, daily log and GAIT summary; provide next phase entry point before /clear (FR-011).

## Dependencies and execution

T001–T003 precede T004–T006. Review work T007–T013 can be interleaved once the evidence ledger exists. Repair task additions (T014) depend on confirmed findings and an analysis pass; exact repairs are never an unspecified license to rewrite unrelated code. US2 follows the corresponding reviewed subsystem; US3 follows breaking-change classification, and may be not-applicable only with an explicit no-breaking-change inventory. US4 follows each repair batch and concludes after verification. T026–T027 require completion of all applicable earlier tasks.

## Parallel opportunities

- [x] T110 [US2] Reproduce/fix A124-070 mobile headless reconnect leaking a client that finishes after the caller times out in lib/ncfed/headless_connect.dart; verify late completion closes once and ordinary success remains open in test/headless_connect_test.dart, then run Flutter tests/analyze serially.

- [x] T098 [US2] Fix A124-059 tests/redfish/run-tests.sh mistaking an unrelated HTTP 404 service for its fixture; require successful HTTP response, support isolated REDFISH_TEST_URL, verify absent/wrong-service and digest-pinned mock cases.
- [x] T099 [US1] Reproduce and fix A124-060 Chroma count failures reported as an empty RAG corpus in storage/chroma_store.py and rag_mcp_server.py; test actual store-to-search error propagation in tests/unit/test_rag_ingest_guards.py.
- [x] T100 [US2] Reproduce/fix A124-061 installer success exit after component or required token dependency failure in scripts/install.sh and scripts/lib/install-steps.sh; add isolated CLI regressions in tests/unit/test_installer_exit_status.py and retain all failure details.
- [x] T101 [US1] Reproduce/fix A124-062 RAG replica promotion deleting stable data before staging rename; retain rollback collection, restore on rename failure and test real Chroma state in tests/unit/test_rag_replica_promotion.py. Document interrupted promotion recovery limits.

- [x] T103 [US3] Fix A124-064 pyATS in-place runtime replacement after reproduced package failure breaks the old interpreter: add scripts/setup-pyats-runtime.py staged source/venv generations, preview/repeat/restore/failure tests in tests/unit/test_pyats_runtime_recovery.py; wire installer, bridge and migrate-pyats-http.py to the managed source path and document recovery.

Independent read-only scans or separate isolated suites can run concurrently; shared-file edits remain sequential. Examples: US1 installer versus RAG review; US2 token-budget versus HUD tests; US3 migrations against separate temporary fixtures; US4 link checking versus count reconciliation. No sub-agents are requested or spawned.

## Implementation strategy

Start with a complete inventory and honest baseline, then close high-impact reproducible defects in bounded batches. Keep the repository usable between batches. Do not declare audit completion while confirmed defects or required acceptance checks remain unresolved. New findings receive numbered tasks and analysis before implementation.

- [x] T084 [US1] Fix A124-045 syslog TCP unbounded buffering/task admission, incorrect peer identity and active-client shutdown in mcp-servers/syslog-mcp/tcp_receiver.py; verify real loopback delivery, resource rejection and stop cleanup in tests/unit/test_syslog_tcp_limits.py; document framing and limits (FR-003, FR-005).

- [x] T085 [US1] Resolve A124-046 telemetry GAIT placeholders in syslog/snmptrap/ipfix gait_logger.py and affected status/docs; explicitly distinguish ordinary logs from persisted GAIT records, verify failure visibility and avoid an unbounded per-message audit workload (FR-003, FR-005, FR-010, FR-011).

- [x] T086 [US1] Fix A124-047 in the three telemetry udp_receiver.py implementations: enforce pending-handler admission before task creation, count dropped datagrams, cancel/join owned tasks on stop and expose transport counters through receiver status; verify overload and normal delivery/shutdown (FR-003, FR-005).

- [x] T087 [US2] Fix A124-048 direct/module package startup for the three telemetry MCP servers and the shadowed bytes annotation in ipfix-mcp/models.py; declare a telemetry suite with actual parser/runtime dependencies and test stdio initialization/tool discovery/status plus localhost syslog ingestion/audit shutdown (FR-004, FR-005, FR-008, FR-010).

- [x] T088 [US3] Fix A124-049 in scripts/run-contract-tests.py: restrict environment destinations, refuse unowned runtime replacement, preserve managed runtime on failed preparation, and test negative paths plus successful/failed refresh in tests/unit/test_contract_runtime_preservation.py (FR-003, FR-005, FR-007, FR-009).

- [x] T089 [US3] Resolve A124-050 in shared helpers in scripts/migrate-voice-auth.py and its six environment-migration consumers: record private after-state digest, reject conflicting/legacy restore without overwrite, and test successful/repeated/conflicting/interrupted restore while preserving unrelated values (FR-005, FR-007, FR-009).

- [x] T090 [US1] Fix A124-051 through ui/netclaw-visual/src/security/safe-html.js and all main/panel HTML sinks; use maintained DOMPurify, test adversarial DOM and rendering preservation, and rerun Node tests/build/browser checks (FR-003, FR-005, FR-010).

- [x] T091 [US1] Fix A124-052 with ui/netclaw-visual/src/security/private-files.js, wire HUD env/testbed/config updates, test literal values/injection/private atomic writes/recovery, and add scripts/migrate-local-file-permissions.py with preview/apply/restore tests and docs (FR-003, FR-005, FR-007, FR-010).

- [x] T092 [US2] Fix A124-053 in federation/channel.py and edge.py: unconditional pending cleanup, bounded send/response deadline and reliable close completion; test send failure/cancellation/timeout/disconnect and successful response using actual classes, then rerun n2n contracts (FR-003, FR-005).

- [x] T093 [US1] Fix A124-054 with process-wide count/byte admission in federation/channel.py, reject overload before spawning, release reservations when handlers settle, test cross-channel/byte-limit recovery and preserve heartbeat multiplexing; document overload behavior (FR-003, FR-005, FR-006).

- [x] T094 [US2] Fix A124-055 HUD RAG subprocess command construction for checkout paths containing spaces/apostrophes in server.js and src/security/command.js; verify the generated command with the actual Python shlex parser (FR-005, FR-014).
